# How to Fix \_BinkShouldSkip@4 Error in Binkw32.dll
 
If you are trying to play a game that uses the Bink Video codec, you may encounter an error message like this:

[**Download**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbyltly.com%2F2tK56G&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1CTs7nI19OwFavpYX8drpk)

 

> The procedure entry point \_BinkShouldSkip@4 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll.

This error means that the game is trying to access a function in the binkw32.dll file that is not available or compatible with your system. This can happen if you are using a cracked or modified version of the game, or if the binkw32.dll file is corrupted or outdated.
 
Fortunately, there are some ways to fix this error and enjoy your game. Here are some steps you can try:
 
1. **Reinstall the game**. This is the simplest and most recommended solution, as it will ensure that you have the original and latest version of the game and the binkw32.dll file. Make sure to uninstall the game completely before reinstalling it, and follow the instructions from the game developer.
2. **Download and install the RAD Video Tools**. The RAD Video Tools are a set of software tools that allow you to play, convert, and edit Bink Video files. They also include the binkw32.dll file that may fix your error. You can download them for free from [https://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm](https://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm) [^2^]. After downloading, run the setup file and follow the instructions to install them on your system.
3. **Copy the binkw32.dll file from the game folder to the system folder**. Sometimes, the game may have its own version of the binkw32.dll file that is different from the one in your system folder. To fix this, you can try copying the binkw32.dll file from the game installation folder (usually located in C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)) to your system folder (usually located in C:\Windows\System32 or C:\Windows\SysWOW64). This will overwrite the existing binkw32.dll file in your system folder with the one from the game folder.

After trying any of these steps, restart your computer and try running the game again. Hopefully, this will resolve your error and let you enjoy your game without any problems.
 
If none of these steps work, you may have a more serious issue with your system or your game. In that case, you may need to contact your game developer or a professional technician for further assistance.
  
What is Bink Video codec and why is it used for games? Bink Video codec is a video compression and playback technology developed by RAD Game Tools, Inc. It is designed specifically for games, as it offers high quality, low latency, and low overhead video playback. Bink Video codec can handle any resolution, frame rate, or color depth, and it supports alpha blending, mip-mapping, scaling, rotation, and more. Bink Video codec can also compress and play back high dynamic range (HDR) videos, which have a wider range of colors and brightness than standard videos.
 
Bink Video codec is widely used by game developers, as it has been licensed for over 15,000 games on 14 different platforms[^1^]. Some of the popular games that use Bink Video codec include Age of Empires III, BioShock, Civilization VI, Doom Eternal, Fallout 4, Grand Theft Auto V, Hitman 3, The Last of Us Part II, Mass Effect Andromeda, Red Dead Redemption 2, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Tomb Raider (2013), and many more. Bink Video codec allows game developers to create immersive and cinematic video experiences for their players, without compromising on performance or quality.
 
How does Bink Video codec work? Bink Video codec uses a proprietary compression algorithm that is optimized for speed and quality. Bink Video codec divides each video frame into 8x8 blocks and applies different compression techniques to each block depending on its content. For example, blocks with smooth gradients are compressed using DCT (discrete cosine transform), blocks with sharp edges are compressed using wavelets, and blocks with motion are compressed using vector quantization. Bink Video codec also uses temporal compression to exploit the similarities between consecutive frames.
 
Bink Video codec can decode video frames using either the CPU or the GPU of the system. Bink Video codec can take advantage of multiple CPU cores and SIMD instructions to achieve fast and parallel decoding. Bink Video codec can also use GPU acceleration to offload some of the decoding tasks to the graphics card. This can reduce the CPU load and improve the frame rate of the game. Bink Video codec can also use GPU shaders to apply effects such as color grading, tone mapping, gamma correction, and more to the video frames.
